---Team Goals---

Wk 1: 	Complete Aim 1, start on Aim 2, complete background section
	(1) Get initial ODE working
	(2) Create stimulation inputs
	(3) Fit params to existing data - parameter estimation

	(4) Finalize network properties of rich club (lit search)
	(5) Create initial code for connecting neurons together 
	(6) Create initial code for stimulating a small group of neurons (make it so that % neurons stimulated can be modified)

	(7) Write background section (by Fri 17th)

Wk 2:	Work on Aim 2 + methods section
	(1) Create rich-club networks + look at summed activity

	(2) Generate several networks + compare activities, measure mean and variance of response amplitude
	(3) Generate networks of different sizes + compare activities, measure mean + variance of response amplitude
	(4) Use different % neurons stimulated + compare activities, mean + variance of response amplitude

	(5) Compare results from (1-4) to lit results
	(6) Write methods section (by Fri)

Wk 3:	Verification/validation analysis + results section
	(1) bifurcation analysis (equation parameters, network size param, neurons stimulated param)
	(2) results validation to lit results
	(3) verification: steady state analysis (SS is zero/no spiking so make sure model does this)
	(4) other verification + validation
	(5) write results section

Wk 4:	Revise final project document + prepare presentation + buffer time for previous weeks

---Decision Making---

During times of disagreement, we will have a democratic vote. 

---Accountability---

Come to all class sessions. Wednesday and Thursday lab groups (2 people per lab, Samantha comes to both). Potentially everyone comes together on Thursdays when we need to have more group cohesion.  

Other meeting times will be established via group chat.

---Communication---

Facebook group.
