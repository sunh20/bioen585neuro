Wk 0.5: Orientation + project understanding
	(1) Get familiar with Github
	(2) Get up to speed with understanding project (papers)
	(3) Set meeting times + expectations
	(4) Review timeline

Wk 1: 	Complete Aim 1, start on Aim 2, background section
	(1) Get initial ODE working
	(2) Create stimulation inputs
	(3) Fit params to existing data - parameter estimation

	(4) Finalize network properties of rich club (lit search)
	(5) Create initial code for connecting neurons together 
	(6) Create initial code for stimulating a small group of neurons (make it so that % neurons stimulated can be modified)

	(7) Write background section (by Fri 17th)

Wk 2:	Work on Aim 2 + methods section
	(1) Create rich-club networks + look at summed activity

	(2) Generate several networks + compare activities, measure mean and variance of response amplitude
	(3) Generate networks of different sizes + compare activities, measure mean + variance of response amplitude
	(4) Use different % neurons stimulated + compare activities, mean + variance of response amplitude

	(5) Compare results from (1-4) to lit results
	(6) Write methods section (by Fri)

Wk 3:	Verification/validation analysis + results section
	(1) bifurcation analysis (equation parameters, network size param, neurons stimulated param)
	(2) results validation to lit results
	(3) verification: steady state analysis (SS is zero/no spiking so make sure model does this)
	(4) other verification + validation
	(5) write results section

Wk 4:	Revise final project document + prepare presentation + buffer time for previous weeks
